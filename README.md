CS-340 Dashboard project

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Organization of the program is important to keep functionality in places that can reused and refactored easily if needed. We did this with CRUD methods in one file and the dashboard in another. Organization of the code with the files is also important. The dashboard project had the imports and assignment of variables at the top, the display then the methods at the bottom. The code contained comments that are helpful in understanding the functionality. The CRUD Python module is very useful and could easily integrate with many projects. I have a recipe project I've been tinkering with that could benfit from this. The read function for retrieving recipes and create for adding new recipes.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist there are several things to think about when solving a problem. Finding an efficient, scalable solution is key to creating something value for the client. Since this project wasn't just focused on one aspect but the whole thing I had to really think about how things needed work together and understand the requirements to adjust the CRUD functions to work well. For instance using find versus find_all versus find_one for the read function. It was big picture thinking. In the future I would test more and ensure I fully understand the requirements. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer sciencist are problem solvers! We create technic projects that solve problems that people have. This project make getting various tasks done more quickly and efficient giving the person more time for other tasks.
